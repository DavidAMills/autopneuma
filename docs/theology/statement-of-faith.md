# Statement of Faith

## Our Mission

We are here to build a Christian community that supports and spreads the Gospel for the glory of our Lord — creating and growing the community of Christ through our many gifts, which share the love and grace of the same eternal Spirit.

> *"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them."* — 1 Corinthians 12:4

## Our Foundation

Auto Pneuma is built on Bible-based Christian faith as revealed in Scripture. We unite around essential Christian beliefs rooted in the unity of the Spirit while celebrating the diversity of gifts and perspectives within the Body of Christ.

## Core Beliefs

### 1. The Triune God

We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person of the Trinity is fully God, co-equal and co-eternal, yet there is only one God.

**Scripture**: Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; John 1:1-3, 14

### 2. The Authority of Scripture

We believe the Bible, consisting of the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It is our final authority for faith, life, and practice.

**Scripture**: 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21; Psalm 119:105

### 3. Creation and the Image of God (Imago Dei)

We believe God created all things, visible and invisible, and that humanity is uniquely created in His image. This divine imprint gives inherent dignity, worth, and moral responsibility to every human being.

**Scripture**: Genesis 1:1, 26-27; Colossians 1:16; Psalm 139:13-14

**Implication for AI**: Our work with artificial intelligence must always honor the unique nature of human beings as image-bearers of God, never seeking to replace or diminish human dignity.

### 4. The Person and Work of Jesus Christ

We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His substitutionary death on the cross for our sins, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His future return in glory.

**Scripture**: John 1:1, 14; Isaiah 7:14; 1 Peter 2:22; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Acts 1:9-11; Revelation 19:11-16

### 5. Salvation by Grace Through Faith

We believe salvation is a gift of God's grace, received through faith in Jesus Christ alone. It is not earned by works but produces good works as fruit of genuine faith.

**Scripture**: Ephesians 2:8-9; John 3:16; Romans 3:23-24; James 2:17

### 6. The Holy Spirit

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, who convicts of sin, regenerates believers, indwells all who trust in Christ, and empowers them for life and service. The Spirit distributes spiritual gifts to believers for the building up of the Church.

**Scripture**: John 16:7-11; Titus 3:5; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11; Galatians 5:22-23

**Foundation for Our Mission**: The Holy Spirit is the "same Spirit" who unifies us and distributes "many gifts" — the very heart of Auto Pneuma's vision.

### 7. The Church

We believe the Church is the Body of Christ, composed of all true believers from every tribe, tongue, and nation. Local churches are gatherings of believers for worship, fellowship, teaching, and mission.

**Scripture**: 1 Corinthians 12:12-27; Ephesians 4:11-16; Matthew 16:18; Acts 2:42-47

### 8. Unity in Christ

We affirm the essentials of Bible-based Christian faith while extending grace in secondary matters. We welcome all believers who follow Christ and affirm these core beliefs.

**Scripture**: Romans 14:1-13; Ephesians 4:3-6; Philippians 2:1-2

### 9. The Great Commission and Cultural Mandate

We believe Christians are called both to make disciples of all nations (the Great Commission) and to exercise stewardship over creation (the Cultural Mandate). Technology, when aligned with God's purposes, is a means of fulfilling both callings.

**Scripture**: Matthew 28:18-20; Genesis 1:28; Colossians 3:23-24

**Implication for Technology**: Our work in AI and technology is an act of worship and stewardship, done for God's glory and humanity's flourishing.

### 10. Truth and the Spirit of Truth

We believe Jesus Christ is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6), and that the Holy Spirit is the "Spirit of truth" who guides believers into all truth. In our technological work, we commit to pursuing truth with integrity, avoiding deception, and building systems that honor reality as God has created it.

**Scripture**: John 14:6; John 16:13; Proverbs 12:22; Ephesians 4:25

**Implication for AI**: We reject the use of AI for deception, manipulation, or the distortion of truth. We commit to transparency, honesty, and ethical use of artificial intelligence.

### 11. The Return of Christ and Eternity

We believe in the personal, visible return of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of the dead, final judgment, and eternal destiny — either in the presence of God or separated from Him.

**Scripture**: 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 20:11-15; John 5:28-29

**Implication for Technology**: Our work is temporal but can have eternal significance. We build not for the glory of technology itself, but for the glory of God and the good of people who bear His image.

## Our Unity: 1 Corinthians 12

The inspiration for Auto Pneuma comes from 1 Corinthians 12, particularly verse 4:

> *"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit."*

This passage teaches us:
- **Unity in the Spirit**: We are one Body, unified by the same Holy Spirit
- **Diversity in Gifts**: God distributes different gifts, abilities, and callings to different members
- **Common Purpose**: All gifts are "for the common good" (v. 7) — to build up the Body and serve others
- **Mutual Dependence**: No gift is superior; all are necessary and valuable

This theological foundation shapes how we approach AI and technology:
- We welcome diverse skills, perspectives, and innovations (**many gifts**)
- We maintain unity around core Christian truth and values (**same Spirit**)
- We build for the common good, not individual glory
- We honor every contribution, recognizing God as the ultimate source

## Theological Accountability

We recognize the need for ongoing theological discernment, especially as we navigate emerging technologies. Our advisory board includes:
- Pastors and theologians
- Ethicists with expertise in technology
- Experienced Christian leaders in AI and software development

We commit to:
- Regular review of our Statement of Faith
- Theological oversight of platform development
- Open dialogue on complex ethical and theological questions
- Humble correction when we err

## Unity in the Body of Christ

We hold firmly to Bible-based Christian beliefs rooted in Scripture and welcome all believers who follow Christ and affirm these essentials.

We agree to disagree charitably on secondary matters while maintaining unity in the Spirit and the truth of the Gospel. Our focus is Christ, His Gospel, and the work of the Holy Spirit in building His Church.

## In Summary

We believe:
- **One God**: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
- **One Gospel**: Salvation by grace through faith in Christ alone
- **One Scripture**: The Bible as God's authoritative Word
- **One Church**: The Body of Christ across all times and places
- **One Mission**: To glorify God and love our neighbors through all of life, including technology
