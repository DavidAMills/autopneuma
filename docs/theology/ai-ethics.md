# AI Ethics Framework

## Biblical Principles for Artificial Intelligence Development

As Christians working with AI technology, we are called to stewardship, wisdom, and love. This framework guides our ethical approach to building, deploying, and using artificial intelligence.

> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters."* — Colossians 3:23

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Imago Dei: Honoring Human Dignity

**Principle**: Every human being is created in the image of God and possesses inherent, immeasurable worth.

**Scripture**: Genesis 1:27; Psalm 139:13-14; James 3:9

**Application to AI**:
- AI must never be used to dehumanize, objectify, or diminish human dignity
- AI should augment human capabilities, not replace the unique role of humans as God's image-bearers
- Systems must respect human autonomy, agency, and moral responsibility
- AI decisions affecting human lives must include human oversight and accountability

**Red Lines**:
- ❌ Creating AI systems designed to manipulate or deceive
- ❌ Using AI to exploit people for gain
- ❌ Building systems that remove human agency in critical decisions
- ❌ Developing AI that mimics or replaces spiritual relationships

### 2. Stewardship: Responsible Development and Use

**Principle**: We are stewards, not owners, of the technology we create. God entrusts us with knowledge and resources to serve others faithfully.

**Scripture**: 1 Corinthians 4:2; Matthew 25:14-30; Luke 12:48

**Application to AI**:
- Develop AI with long-term consequences in mind, not just short-term gains
- Consider environmental impact (energy consumption, resource use)
- Ensure accessibility and equitable distribution of benefits
- Build systems that are maintainable, documented, and sustainable

**Questions to Ask**:
- Who benefits from this AI system?
- Who might be harmed?
- Are we using resources wisely?
- What are the unintended consequences?

### 3. Truth and Integrity

**Principle**: Christ is the Truth, and the Spirit is the Spirit of Truth. Our work must reflect honesty, transparency, and reality as God has created it.

**Scripture**: John 14:6; John 16:13; Proverbs 12:22; Ephesians 4:25

**Application to AI**:
- AI outputs should be accurate, reliable, and trustworthy
- Transparency about AI capabilities and limitations
- Clear disclosure when content is AI-generated
- No deceptive use of deepfakes, synthetic media, or impersonation
- Honest representation of AI system biases and uncertainties

**Commitments**:
- ✅ Clearly label AI-generated content
- ✅ Disclose AI involvement in decision-making
- ✅ Acknowledge limitations and failure modes
- ✅ Correct errors and misinformation promptly

### 4. Justice and Fairness

**Principle**: God calls us to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly. AI systems must be fair and must not perpetuate injustice.

**Scripture**: Micah 6:8; Proverbs 31:8-9; Isaiah 1:17

**Application to AI**:
- Actively work to identify and mitigate bias in datasets and algorithms
- Ensure fair and just treatment of all people as image-bearers of God
- Provide recourse and accountability when AI systems cause harm
- Serve all people faithfully and responsibly

**Technical Considerations**:
- Quality and completeness of training data
- Algorithmic fairness metrics
- Testing for just and accurate outcomes
- Accessibility for people with disabilities

### 5. Love of Neighbor

**Principle**: The second greatest commandment is to love our neighbor as ourselves. AI development must be motivated by love and service, not exploitation or harm.

**Scripture**: Matthew 22:39; John 13:34-35; 1 Corinthians 13:4-7

**Application to AI**:
- Prioritize human flourishing over profit or efficiency
- Design with empathy for end users
- Consider the impact on communities, not just individuals
- Build systems that promote human connection, not isolation

**Questions to Ask**:
- Does this AI serve people or exploit them?
- Would I want this system used on my family?
- Does this promote human flourishing?
- Are we treating users as neighbors or as resources?

### 6. Wisdom and Humility

**Principle**: The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. We approach AI development with humility, recognizing the limits of human knowledge and the potential for unintended harm.

**Scripture**: Proverbs 9:10; James 1:5; Proverbs 11:2

**Application to AI**:
- Acknowledge that we don't fully understand complex AI systems (especially deep learning)
- Conduct thorough testing and risk assessment before deployment
- Seek diverse perspectives and external accountability
- Be willing to pause or stop development when risks are unclear
- Learn from failures and near-misses

**Humble Practices**:
- Red-teaming and adversarial testing
- External ethics reviews
- Phased rollouts with monitoring
- Willingness to say "we don't know"

### 7. Redemptive Technology

**Principle**: All creation groans for redemption. Technology, while fallen, can be used redemptively to restore, heal, and serve.

**Scripture**: Romans 8:19-22; Colossians 1:20; Revelation 21:5

**Application to AI**:
- Use AI to address real human needs (health, education, accessibility)
- Build tools that restore dignity to the marginalized
- Prioritize applications that heal rather than harm
- Seek to redeem technology from exploitative or harmful uses

**Redemptive Use Cases**:
- Medical diagnosis and treatment tools
- Educational resources and learning tools
- Accessibility technologies for people with disabilities
- Environmental stewardship and monitoring
- Translation and communication tools

### 8. Community and Accountability

**Principle**: We are not lone actors but part of the Body of Christ. Ethical AI development requires community, transparency, and accountability.

**Scripture**: 1 Corinthians 12:12-27; Proverbs 15:22; Ecclesiastes 4:9-12

**Application to AI**:
- Open discussion of ethical challenges
- Peer review and collaborative decision-making
- Whistleblower protections for those who identify harms
- External oversight and accountability structures
- Sharing of best practices and lessons learned

**Accountability Mechanisms**:
- Advisory boards with diverse expertise
- Ethics review committees
- Transparent reporting of AI incidents and failures
- Community forums for ethical discussion

## Specific Application Areas

**This means**:
- No deepfakes designed to impersonate or deceive
- No dark patterns or manipulative design
- No AI-powered misinformation or propaganda
- Clear labeling of AI-generated content

### AI and Privacy

**Commitment**: We respect the privacy and dignity of individuals.

**This means**:
- Minimal data collection (only what's necessary)
- Transparent data practices
- User control over personal data
- Strong security to prevent breaches

### AI and Autonomy

**Commitment**: We preserve human agency and decision-making.

**This means**:
- Humans remain in the loop for critical decisions
- AI provides recommendations, not mandates
- Users can opt out or override AI decisions
- No coercive or manipulative AI systems

### AI and Labor

**Commitment**: We consider the impact on workers and communities.

**This means**:
- Transparent communication about automation impacts
- Support for workforce transitions
- Fair compensation and working conditions
- Prioritizing augmentation over replacement when possible

### AI and Spiritual Formation

**Commitment**: AI must not replace or diminish genuine spiritual relationships with God and others.

**This means**:
- AI can assist with Bible study but cannot replace the Holy Spirit
- AI can facilitate community but cannot replace the Church
- AI can provide information but cannot replace wisdom
- AI can offer comfort but cannot replace pastoral care

## Decision-Making Framework

When facing an ethical dilemma in AI development, ask:

1. **Does this honor the image of God in every person?**
2. **Am I being a faithful steward of this technology?**
3. **Is this truthful and transparent?**
4. **Does this promote justice and fairness?**
5. **Is this motivated by love for my neighbor?**
6. **Am I proceeding with wisdom and humility?**
7. **Does this contribute to human flourishing and redemption?**
8. **Have I sought community input and accountability?**

If the answer to any of these is "no" or "I'm not sure," proceed with caution or reconsider.

## Ongoing Discernment

Technology evolves rapidly. This framework is not exhaustive but foundational. We commit to:
- Regular review and updating of ethical guidelines
- Staying informed about AI capabilities and risks
- Learning from ethical failures in the industry
- Engaging with diverse voices in the ethics conversation
- Seeking God's wisdom through prayer and Scripture

## Theological Tensions

We acknowledge tensions that require ongoing discernment:
- **Innovation vs. Caution**: How do we pursue beneficial AI while avoiding harm?
- **Efficiency vs. Human Connection**: When does automation diminish human relationships?
- **Capability vs. Wisdom**: Just because we can build something, should we?
- **Global Access vs. Risk**: How do we democratize AI while preventing misuse?

These tensions are not problems to be solved but realities to be navigated with wisdom, prayer, and community.

## Call to Action

As Christian technologists, we are called to:
- **Build differently**: Prioritize ethics over speed-to-market
- **Speak prophetically**: Call out harmful uses of AI
- **Serve faithfully**: Use AI to serve all people as unto the Lord
- **Work collaboratively**: Join with others who share these values
- **Pray continually**: Seek God's wisdom and guidance in all we build
