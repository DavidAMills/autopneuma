# Moderation Policy

## Grace and Truth in Community Management

Moderation at Auto Pneuma is guided by the balance Jesus exemplified: **grace and truth** (John 1:14). We extend patience and forgiveness while upholding biblical standards and community safety.

> *"Speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ."* â€” Ephesians 4:15

## Moderation Philosophy

### Grace

- **Assumption of Good Intent**: We assume members mean well unless proven otherwise
- **Education First**: We teach before we punish
- **Restorative Justice**: The goal is restoration, not punishment
- **Second Chances**: We believe in redemption and growth
- **Patience**: We allow time for correction and change

### Truth

- **Clear Standards**: Our [Community Guidelines](community-guidelines.md) are explicit and binding
- **Consistent Enforcement**: Rules apply equally to all members
- **Safety Priority**: We protect the community from harm
- **Accountability**: Violations have consequences
- **No Compromise on Essentials**: Core theological and ethical standards are non-negotiable

## Moderation Tiers

- Mildly off-topic discussions
- Unintentional breach of etiquette
- First-time minor infractions
- Tone that could be more charitable

**Response**:

## Special Cases

### Theological Concerns

**In-Bounds** (welcome discussion):
- Application of biblical principles to AI ethics
- Different perspectives on secondary matters (within our [Statement of Faith](../theology/statement-of-faith.md))
- Thoughtful questions about theology and technology

**Out-of-Bounds** (violation):
- Denial of core Christian beliefs (Trinity, authority of Scripture, deity of Christ, etc.)
- Prolonged debates on secondary matters unrelated to our mission
- Questioning others' salvation based on secondary doctrines
- Using the platform for theological controversies unrelated to AI and technology

**Moderation Response**:
1. Redirect to appropriate forums for theological debate
2. If persistent, private conversation with moderator
3. If teaching clearly contradicts Statement of Faith, removal from the platform

### AI Ethics Violations

**Examples**:
- Promoting deceptive use of AI (deepfakes for impersonation, manipulative design)
- Sharing code or tools designed to harm
- Advocating for unethical AI applications

**Moderation Response**:
1. **Immediate Removal** of content
2. **Warning or Suspension** depending on severity and intent
3. **Conversation**: Educate on our [AI Ethics Framework](../theology/ai-ethics.md)
4. If repeated or intentional, **permanent ban**

### Sensitive Topics

**Topics requiring extra care**:
- Politics (unless directly related to AI policy or Christian engagement with technology)
- Social controversies unrelated to our mission
- Personal disputes or grievances

**Moderation Approach**:
- Encourage members to stay focused on our mission
- Redirect to more appropriate forums if necessary
- Step in if discussions become divisive or uncharitable

## Moderation Process

### How Content is Reviewed

1. **Community Reports**: Members flag content that violates guidelines
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: Moderators review discussions, especially new or active threads
3. **AI-Assisted Flagging**: Automated systems flag potentially problematic content for moderator review (never auto-delete)

### Moderator Actions

1. **Review**: Moderator examines the reported content and context
2. **Consult** (if needed): Discuss with other moderators or leadership for complex cases
3. **Decision**: Determine appropriate action based on this policy
4. **Action**: Remove content, warn member, or take other steps
5. **Communication**: Notify the member privately with explanation and reference to guidelines
6. **Record**: Log the action for accountability and pattern tracking

### Response Time

- **Severe violations** (Tier 4): Immediate action
- **Reports**: Reviewed within 24 hours
- **Appeals**: Responded to within 7 days

## Appeals Process

If you believe a moderation decision was incorrect, you may appeal:

### How to Appeal

1. **Email**: Contact moderators@autopneuma.com with:
   - Your username
   - Description of the incident
   - Why you believe the decision was incorrect
   - Any relevant context or information

2. **Review**: A different moderator (not the one who issued the warning/suspension) reviews the appeal
3. **Decision**: Appeal decision made within 7 days
4. **Final Appeal**: If unsatisfied, escalate to the Advisory Board (for serious cases only)

### Outcomes

- **Upheld**: Original decision stands
- **Modified**: Reduced consequence (e.g., warning instead of suspension)
- **Overturned**: Decision reversed, record cleared

## Transparency

### Public Accountability

- Moderator actions are logged and reviewable by leadership
- Quarterly summary reports shared with the community (anonymized)
- Major incidents or policy changes communicated clearly

### Private Communication

- Specific moderation actions are handled privately to protect dignity
- Public statements made only when necessary for community safety

## Moderator Conduct

Moderators are held to **higher standards** and must:
- Model the Fruits of the Spirit
- Apply policies consistently and fairly
- Communicate respectfully and clearly
- Seek counsel when uncertain
- Recuse themselves from decisions involving personal conflicts

**Moderator violations** are handled by leadership and may result in removal from the moderator role.

## Restoration Process

For members suspended or banned, restoration may be possible if:
- The member acknowledges the violation
- Demonstrates genuine repentance and desire to change
- Time has passed for reflection (minimum 6-12 months for severe cases)
- Advisory Board approves restoration (for bans)

**Process**:
1. **Request**: Email leadership with request for restoration
2. **Conversation**: Discussion with moderators or Advisory Board
3. **Probation**: Trial period with close monitoring
4. **Full Restoration**: If probation is successful

We believe in **redemption** and second chances, but restoration requires genuine change.

## Edge Cases and Discretion

Moderators have discretion to:
- Issue lighter consequences for first-time, minor violations
- Escalate consequences for members with repeated violations
- Make judgment calls in ambiguous situations

All discretionary decisions are reviewable by leadership and subject to appeal.

## Reporting

### How to Report Violations

- **Report Button**: Use the built-in report feature on posts/comments
- **Email**: moderators@autopneuma.com
- **Anonymous**: Use the anonymous reporting form (link provided in the platform)

**What to Include**:
- Link to the content or description of the incident
- Specific guideline violated
- Any relevant context

### Confidentiality

- Reporter identity is kept confidential when possible
- False or malicious reports may result in consequences for the reporter

## FAQ

### Q: What if I accidentally violate a guideline?

A: Don't worry! We assume good intent. If it's minor, you'll likely receive a friendly reminder. We all make mistakes.

### Q: Can I disagree with someone's theology?

A: Yes, if it's relevant to our mission and done respectfully. Focus on ideas, not personal attacks. Affirm our shared commitment to the Statement of Faith while discussing secondary matters charitably.

### Q: What if a moderator is unfair to me?

A: Use the appeals process. Your appeal will be reviewed by a different moderator and, if necessary, by leadership.

### Q: Can I post about my Christian AI project?

A: Yes! Sharing relevant projects is encouraged. Just ensure it's not purely self-promotional and adds value to the community.

### Q: What if I see something harmful but I'm not sure if it violates guidelines?

A: Report it anyway. We'd rather review it and decide it's fine than have harmful content go unreported.

## Conclusion

Moderation exists to **protect and nurture** our community. We aim to balance firmness with grace, truth with love, and standards with mercy.

Our prayer is that Auto Pneuma remains a safe, welcoming, and edifying space for Christians to explore AI, technology, and faith together.

> *"Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace."* â€” Ephesians 4:3
