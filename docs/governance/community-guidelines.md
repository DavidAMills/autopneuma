# Community Guidelines

## The Fruits of the Spirit as Our Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Auto Pneuma community! We are a gathering of Christian developers, engineers, data scientists, and technologists united by the same Spirit and working to build ethical AI for Kingdom impact.

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise:

1. **Assume the best** — Misunderstandings are common in online communication

3. **Seek reconciliation** — The goal is restoration, not winning an argument
4. **Involve a moderator** — If direct conversation doesn't resolve the issue
5. **Trust the process** — Our moderation team operates with grace and truth

**Matthew 18:15-17** guides our approach:
> *"If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church."*

## Moderation and Enforcement
