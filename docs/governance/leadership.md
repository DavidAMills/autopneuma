## A Word on Authority and Service

Leadership in Auto Pneuma is not about power or control, but about **service and stewardship**. Jesus' words guide us:

> *"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave — just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."* — Matthew 20:25-28

We lead by serving. We exercise authority with humility. We seek the good of the community, not our own glory.
