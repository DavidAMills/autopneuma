## Budget Considerations

### MVP (Minimal Costs)
- **Supabase**: Free tier (up to 500MB database, 2GB file storage)
- **Vercel**: Free tier (unlimited deployments)
- **Fly.io/Railway**: ~$10-20/month (FastAPI service)
- **Domain**: ~$20/year (autopneuma.com already owned)
- **AI APIs**: Pay-as-you-go (estimate $50-100/month for MVP)

**Total MVP Cost**: ~$100-150/month

### Scaling (Post-Launch)
- Supabase Pro: ~$25/month
- Vercel Pro: ~$20/month (if needed)
- Fly.io/Railway: ~$50/month (scaling)
- AI APIs: ~$200-500/month
- **Total**: ~$300-600/month

## Technical Dependencies

### Required Accounts
- [ ] Supabase account (database + auth)
- [ ] Vercel account (deployment)
- [ ] Fly.io or Railway account (FastAPI)
- [ ] OpenAI API key
- [ ] Anthropic API key (optional for MVP)
- [ ] ConvertKit or Mailchimp (newsletter)
- [ ] GitHub organization (code hosting)

### Optional Services
- [ ] Sentry (error tracking)
- [ ] Plausible or PostHog (analytics)
- [ ] Cloudflare (CDN, DDoS protection)
- [ ] Algolia (advanced search)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: AI API costs spiral
  - **Mitigation**: Implement aggressive caching, rate limiting, and usage monitoring
- **Risk**: Database performance issues at scale
  - **Mitigation**: Proper indexing, query optimization, read replicas if needed
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: RLS policies, regular security audits, dependency updates

### Community Risks
- **Risk**: Lack of early adoption
  - **Mitigation**: Personal outreach to Christian tech networks, offer value from day one
- **Risk**: Theological controversy or division
  - **Mitigation**: Clear Statement of Faith, strong moderation, focus on essentials
- **Risk**: Burnout of founding team
  - **Mitigation**: Sustainable pace, recruit moderators early, delegate responsibilities

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Set up Supabase project**
   - Create account
   - Apply database schema
   - Configure authentication providers

2. **Initialize Next.js app**
   - Run `npx create-next-app@latest` in apps/autopneuma-web
   - Install dependencies (Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Supabase client)
   - Create base layout and navigation

3. **Create environment variables**
   - Copy .env.example to .env
   - Fill in Supabase credentials
   - Add AI API keys (when ready)

4. **Build landing page**
   - Hero section with mission statement
   - Call-to-action for sign-up
   - Brief overview of features
   - Link to Statement of Faith

5. **Implement authentication**
   - Sign up flow
   - Log in flow
   - Session management
   - Protected routes

## Questions for Decision

1. **Content Strategy**: Who will write initial blog content?
2. **Moderation**: Who will serve as initial moderators?
3. **Advisory Board**: Who are potential candidates for theological/ethical oversight?
4. **Launch Date**: Target date for public launch?
5. **Community Seeding**: How to recruit founding members?
